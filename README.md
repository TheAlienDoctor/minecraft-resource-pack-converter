### Minecraft resource pack converter

## What is this?
Well, if you couldn't tell by the name then its a Minecraft resource pack converter! What does it do? Well it converts Minecraft resource packs between Bedrock and Java, using the powers of magic it is actually able to convert Bedrock to Java, or Java to Bedrock (unlike most other pack converters I have seen)

## Credits
Massive thankyou to SnakeHat, who helped me come up with a way better concept for how this would work (because no one likes re-writing if statements over 1000 times) as well as creating a script c# that generated most of the file name/path variables automatically. You can check out his YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl_gACe1DIiUzcFdsJOBxCQ

And this is the list he used to generate that script (only works for pre 1.16 textures, so I had to manually put in the rest): https://www.planetminecraft.com/blog/json-list-of-all-textures-items-mobs-blocks-etc/
