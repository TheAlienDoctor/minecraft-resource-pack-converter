### Minecraft resource pack converter

<b>Please note: This is currently working progress and not done!</b>

## What is this?
Well, if you couldn't tell by the name then its a Minecraft resource pack converter! What does it do? Well it converts Minecraft resource packs between Bedrock and Java, using the powers of magic it is actually able to convert Bedrock to Java, or Java to Bedrock (unlike most other pack converters I have seen)

## Credits
Massive thankyou to SnakeHat, who helped me come up with a way better concept for how this would work (because no one likes re-writing if statements over 1000 times) and then helping me figuring out how to make that conecept work in AutoIT, despite never using it before as well as generated a script to automate the creation for the majority of the conversion variables.

Also thanks to the AutoIT forums, many old forum posts came in use for this xD
